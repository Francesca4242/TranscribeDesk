	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>This is a hub that allows you to contribute to and check transcriptions and browse through documents for research purposes</p>
	<h1>How to Use</h1>
	<p></p>
	<h3>Search</h3>
	<p>Search through the documents available. View or open in the Transcribe Desk to edit or alter the transcription.</p>
	<h3>Transcribe Desk</h3>
	<p>View the transcription currently available to the documents. You have control of the visibility so can see either the document or transcription itself. Feel free to move the words around or change them if you think they are inaccurate.</p>
	<div id=colourscale></div>
	<p>The colour scale above demonstrates the accuracy of the word transcribed so far. The accuracy will be improved the more the word is verified.</p>
	<h3>Game Zone</h3>
	<p>Play transcription games to help us gain more data. The game works on the basis that the more words transcribed will unlock levels and help you generate fuel.</p>
